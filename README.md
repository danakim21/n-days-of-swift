# n Days of Swift

## Learning Swift 
Inspired by [Allen Wang](https://github.com/allenwong)'s [30 Days of Swift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift/blob/master/README.md), I decided to compile a list of projects I'm working on to master Swift. Most of the projects are guided through a book called "스위프트로 아이폰 앱 만들기 4th Edition" and Paul Hudson's [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).
